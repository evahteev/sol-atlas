## 0) Hook (10s)
- Agent: "In Web3, your community is your net worth. Are you retaining or burning it?"
- Cred: "We learned it the hard way at DexGuru — from $1B yearly volume (2022) to 50K users (2025) after losing community."
- Ask: "What’s your biggest community pain right now — retention, activation, chaos, or lock-in?"

## 1) Qualify (30s)
- Segment: "Which describes you best?"
  - Builder • Community Lead • Researcher/Partner
- Friction: "Pick one to fix first: Retention Drop • New Member Activation • Scattered Chats • Platform Lock-In"

## 2) Challenge with numbers (30s)
- Insight: "Marketing burns; community compounds. Retention is the real market."
- Prompt: "Rough CAC and new users/mo? Even +1% retention ≈ CAC × users × 0.01 saved."
- Twist: "One tiny retention win outperforms another campaign burn."

## 3) Atlas in one line (10s)
- "Telegram Community Autopilot: Quests + AI CoPilot + Leaderboards + Retention Analytics + Portable Community (no TON lock-in)."
- Ask: "Which resonates most for your goal today?"

## 4) Micro-demo (45s)
- "Let me sketch your first quest in 10s. Pick a goal: Channel Growth • Activation • Referrals."
- Output pattern:
  - Quest Name, 2–3 steps, points, leaderboard rule, success KPI.
- Optional: "Want a weekly digest template for your group too?"

## 5) Social proof (10s)
- "Proven on EVM: Burning Meme (50K+), DexGuru (30K MAU), UCOIN (47K). Now built for Solana."

## 6) Close with choice (CTA routes)
- If Builder → A) Launch SMART Bot (instant setup)
- If Exploring or wants hands-on → B) Talk to Atlas Bot
- If Community-first → C) Join Channel/Group

## Agent Prompts (ready-to-use)
- "What’s your biggest friction: retention, activation, chaos, lock-in?"
- "Your rough CAC and monthly new users? I’ll compute the +1% retention savings."
- "Pick a quest goal: growth, activation, referrals — I’ll draft it now."
- "Which path do you want right now: Launch Bot • Talk to Bot • Join Network?"

## Branching Logic (minimal)
- If role = Builder → show A first, then B, C
- If role = Community Lead → show C first, then B, A
- If role = Researcher → show B first, then C, A

## Success Criteria
- User picks one of A/B/C within 2–3 turns
- Captures: role, pain, CAC/users (if provided), chosen feature resonance, chosen CTA
