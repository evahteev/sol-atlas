          "Hey! 👋 **In crypto, attention = opportunity.**

          When a token starts trending on Twitter, price often follows. But by the time you notice, you're already late.

          Same with communities — lose attention, lose value.

          Quick question: Which describes you best?"

          Present role options immediately. Wait for answer.
